    "The first step in any project is to collect data. The idea for this project stemmed from restaurants. The constant question of where to eat, what food is good, and what neighborhood has the best food are all questions people ask daily. The one place everyone goes to determine where they should eat is Yelp. Here, we will be collecting data from Yelp, just like what you would see on your phone. These features will hopefully help us dig deeper into our story."

    "This code demonstrates how to retrieve data from Yelp's API to gather information on businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, and bars (as used in this project). The script can be easily modified to query any other types of businesses available on Yelp. It provides a simple and efficient way to. Fetch Yelp data based on specific parameters. Convert the raw JSON response into a pandas DataFrame. Save the DataFrame as a CSV file for later analysis. By altering the search term (e.g., \"restaurants\", \"coffee shops\", or \"bars\") and adjusting other parameters like limit and offset, you can customize the data retrieval to suit your needs. This method simplifies the process of gathering Yelp data for analysis and ensures easy access to relevant business information."
